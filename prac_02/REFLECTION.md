What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?
60%

What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
I usually arrange my time between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Wednesday to watch TV in the school library or self-study room. 
Each class lasts about one hour, depending on the topic of this week.

What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
Iâ€™ve been consistent in submitting my practicals on time and trying out the optional extension exercises. I will 
continue this practice because it helps reinforce my coding skills.

What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I tend to skip reviewing lecture code examples after watching the videos. I plan to change this by allocating 30 minutes
after each lecture to review and annotate the code in PyCharm.

What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?
Sometimes I rush through the practicals just to finish them, without fully understanding all the details. I will start 
taking notes and write more comments in my code to make sure I understand every part.

What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
I am good at completing grassroots tasks independently and quickly, deepening my understanding of logic.
